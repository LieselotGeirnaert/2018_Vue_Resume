                    <h4>Open Summer Of Code</h4>
                    <h5>fullstack developer</h5>
                    <p>"Open Summer of Code" is a Belgian 4-week summer programme by "Open Knowledge Belgium".
                        The goal of the programme is to provide Belgian based students the training, network and support to transform projects into real-world services.
                        During this month I worked as one of three developers on a project about Linked Open Data for the Flemish government.

                    <h5>coach gymnastics</h5>
                    <p>After many years of doing gymnatics myself, I became the coach of two groups of 20 little girls each, aged 6 and 10 years.
                    After 2 year I became the headcoach of all of the boy- and girlgroups between 5 and 12 years.
                    This means I am the point of contact for the parents and children, make the training- and equipmentschedules for each group and
                    set meetings with the trainers and board.<br> In 2018 I became part of the board myself and started developing a new website for the club.</p>

                    <h5>bartender</h5>
                    <p>I worked as a bartender at Tomorrowland for the third time this year.
                    It is a very fun but hard job with long shifts and little sleep.
                    I learned to work under pressure and without sleep and to always have a 'happy to help'-mentality.</p>
